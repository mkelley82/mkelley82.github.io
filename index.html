								<h2>Bio</h2>
								<p>I have spent nearly my entire adult life as a private contractor/consultant. Each year during tax season I've dutifully filled out a 1099 as I've always been self-employed. I also take on longer contracts, usually in the 3-6 month range, where I am generally a member of a small team working full-time on a fairly large project. Working this way is something I've enjoyed and have been able to make a decent living at thus far. Alas, you don't always know when the next contract is coming and that can be problematic. I love programming in general &mdash; designing, developing, and programming web sites, web apps, databases, and custom business software for Windows&trade; and the Web. I've also been dabbling in mobile development as well on the Android&trade; platform.</p>
								<p>However, I am married and have two beautiful girls that are growing up <em>fast</em>! The youngest is now 8 and the oldest has just turned 10. So I am now seeking a full-time position doing the same type of programming, web development, and design work. My motivation for the change being primarily the stability and insurance benefits. However the team-oriented environment inherent in being directly employed by a company is also very enticing. <!-- Barring full-time employmeny, I'll likely end up finding some office space and starting my own company altogether and taking on some employees of my own. --></p>
								<p><b>If you have a full-time position that fits my skill-set please contact me!<br />

								<h2>Professional Bio/Experience</h2>
								<p>Computers &amp; programming have been a passion of mine since I was twelve. That's 18 years (and growing) of knowledge and experience in the field (~10 years of working experience).  Most of what I know is self-taught through countless hours in-front of the computer 'hacking' away, and I'm still learning almost everyday - one of the great things I love about programming and using computers in general. As for formal education, I do hold an Associate's Degree in Information Technology (IT) from BCTC in Lexington, KY – where I also studied Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</p>
                <p>I specialize in both server &amp; client-side web based application development and design, however I’m no stranger to native Windows software development either. Over the years I've participated in the design and development of everything from various small business and e-commerce websites using good 'ol HTML, Javascript (often using jQuery and various other javascript frameworks) as well as fully featured enterprise-scale web applications using ASP.NET, C#, and VB.NET with assorted database technologies and design patterns. I've also developed custom business software (native Windows applications)  using C# and Win Forms. An example being P&L software that required integration with another 3rd party system's API for Fayette Co. Public Schools. Another notable windows application I designed and developed - a custom inventory, invoice, and asset management windows application for a large food &amp; produce wholesale distributor with a lot of custom features as well as data reporting, visualizations, and alerts.</p>
                <p>As a long-time contractor doing web design &amp; development using various combinations of the technologies, tools, and languages listed above  I have gained a lot of experience working solo and as part of a team, as well as the importance of budgets and deadlines, et. al. One of my favorite projects was SSAVIE (Special Operations Forces Sustainment, Asset Visibility and Information Exchange ).</p>
                <p>It is a large web application built for the Department of Defense/DARPA developed with ASP.NET/C# and Oracle as the database platform. During that project I was primarily responsible for writing mission critical back-end data access/analysis code and stored procedures. Amongst many other features, it tracked soldier/unit inventory across all branches, including special forces. Tracking everything from boxers and socks to M-16’s and Blackhawk helos.  Pretty cool stuff. I worked with a lot of great programmers and really learned a lot about architecting a large application during the course of this project.</p>
                <p>I recently participated as a member of a small team developing a ASP.NET/web-based Electonic Medical Records application for Kentucky's Public Health Department, a fairly complex system involving multiple users across several physical locations developed with Silverlight 5, WCF RIA Services, Entity Framework, and the MVVM design pattern using an Oracle database as the datastore.</p>
                <p>Throughout all of this I have gained a wealth of knowledge and skills. Enough so to say with confidence that I have a pretty well rounded pool of knowledge and experience developing web-based and  native applications. If I don’t  know the solution to a problem, I know how to find the answer. I can work solo, but I also love being part of a team. I primarily consider myself a web developer, though I am comfortable doing native Windows applications as well. Given the opportunity, I am confident I can fill any Sr. level position presented.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <h4>AN EXERCISE IN LEARNING THROUGH DOING.</h4>
                <p>After earning my Associates in IT, I turned to the real world and found the building blocks of knowledge everywhere. Books, the internet, my peers, and mentors... And the tried and true method of getting your hands dirty and learning through good 'ol trial and error (my personal favorite).</p>
                <p>I am currently participating in several of the free online courses offered by Coursera.com, such as “Computing for Data Analyisis”, taught by a professor at Johns Hopkins University. It’s a brand new future in education and it is happening now. These are the same courses taught at the university and all of them are top-notch schools, such as the aforementioned John Hopkins, as well as MIT, Stanford, and others.</p>
                <p>When your work is your passion, it doesn't take much motivation. You just keep your eyes and ears open – and never stop learning. I make it a point to keep up with the latest technology and practices. At all times, striving to excel, and loving every minute of it!</p>
                <br />
                <h5>1994 - PRESENT</h5>
                <p>A continuous process of learning and honing my design &amp; development skills by keeping up with all of the latest technologies, research, and partaking in the all so familiar process of trial and error.</p>
